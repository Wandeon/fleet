# Fleet UI/UX Audit – 2025-09-24

## Executive Summary

- Critical gaps block operators: navigation targets like `/settings`, `/health`, and all `/fleet/*` routes return 404/500 responses (`logs/settings.json`, `logs/health.json`, `logs/fleet-list.json`), leaving configuration and fleet oversight inaccessible.
- Event visibility is broken: the `/logs` page surfaces "Request failed" and the backing API (`/ui/logs`) responds 404, so incidents cannot be reviewed.
- Core media workflows are incomplete: audio lacks an asset library/device matrix, and video exposes only power and volume controls with "Last signal: Invalid Date", preventing upload→select→sync or reliable AV operations.
- Device management surfaces (Zigbee, Camera) present empty tables with no actions, offering no path to pair devices, review state, or acknowledge alerts.
- Status signals are misleading: the global header reports `Offline · 0 ms` while panels claim "All clear" even as primary pages error, eroding operator trust.

**Immediate low-hanging fruit**

- Restore the missing routes (`/settings`, `/health`, `/fleet/*`) and fix the `/ui/logs` endpoint so navigation cards resolve successfully.
- Bubble API failures into the dashboard cards and global status banner instead of masking them behind "All clear" copy.
- Replace placeholder text like "Invalid Date" and populate empty tables with explicit guidance (e.g., "No Zigbee devices registered. Add one →").
- Add contextual labels or helper text next to bare controls (e.g., clarify what `Play on both` targets, what `Replace fallback` does, acceptable file types).

**Long-term redesign recommendations**

- Rebuild audio and video modules around task flows: ingest library management, per-device routing, sync state, preview feedback, and queued actions.
- Create an operations console for Zigbee/Camera with inventory lists, health states, pairing/removal wizards, and timeline of alerts.
- Design a consolidated health view with clear uptime metrics, SLA indicators, and linked remediation playbooks.
- Implement a consistent notification and logging layer that captures API/system errors and presents actionable alerts with timestamps and responsible subsystems.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dashboard** – Cards for Audio, Video, Zigbee, Camera, Recent Errors, and Event Feed; global banner reads `Offline · 0 ms`; Audio block shows `Play on both`, `Pause`, `Master volume 0%` and status "Idle · Queue a track to begin" (see `screenshots/dashboard.png`). | "Offline" conflicts with successful API calls; panels report "All clear" despite downstream 404/500s; Video card's "Last signal: Invalid Date" undermines telemetry; no links or drill-downs from cards, so operators have no path from overview to action. | Source uptime from actual `/ui/*` responses and reflect red/yellow states in cards; link each module card to live detail views; replace placeholder timestamps with valid values or explicit error flags; surface unresolved incidents in Recent Errors/Event Feed. |
| **Audio** – Same layout as dashboard card with additional `Upload` and `Replace fallback` buttons; no device list or queue (see `screenshots/audio.png`).                                                                                                                | Workflow stops after upload: no file picker/library, no target selection, no sync status; buttons lack helper text, so intent is unclear; slider shows 0% with no per-device volumes.                                                                       | Introduce an asset table (title, length, last synced) with bulk actions; show each playback device with online/offline and drift; add descriptive copy or tooltips; gate destructive actions (`Replace fallback`) behind confirmation.                              |
| **Video** – Presents `Power On`, `Power Off`, volume slider, `Mute`; telemetry reads "Last signal: Invalid Date" (see `screenshots/video.png`).                                                                                                                          | Can't select media source or display; no feedback that a command succeeded; invalid timestamp suggests API mismatch; no CEC diagnostics for dual TVs.                                                                                                       | Add source selection, preview thumbnails, and command confirmations; display last heartbeat with relative timestamp and signal quality; include per-display power state plus a sync toggle.                                                                         |
| **Zigbee** – Table skeleton with headers (Name, Type, State, Last seen) but zero rows or actions (see `screenshots/zigbee.png`).                                                                                                                                         | Operators cannot discover, add, or diagnose devices; empty table lacks guidance; no filter/search; hub health unseen.                                                                                                                                       | Provide call-to-action ("Add Zigbee device"), show hub connectivity, and list devices with badges for alerts; add filters and inline diagnostics.                                                                                                                   |
| **Camera** – Minimal card stating "Last motion: None" with `View log` button (see `screenshots/camera.png`).                                                                                                                                                             | No live preview or recent clip gallery; "None" gives no timeframe; button destination unknown (likely `/logs`, which is broken).                                                                                                                            | Embed snapshot/stream placeholder, show motion history timeline, and clarify log destination (with counts); surface camera uptime and last heartbeat.                                                                                                               |
| **Health** – Route returns 500; UI renders generic "Something went wrong" message with no remediation steps (see `screenshots/health.png`, `logs/health.json`).                                                                                                          | Operators cannot view system health; vague error lacks request ID/time; nav still invites users into a dead end.                                                                                                                                            | Fix backend 500; until resolved, hide nav or provide service-status CTA with request ID; log outage in Recent Errors/Event Feed automatically.                                                                                                                      |
| **Logs** – Header claims "Request failed"; network call to `/ui/logs` returns 404 (see `screenshots/logs.png`, `logs/logs.json`).                                                                                                                                        | No audit trail or filtering; repeated reload loops; no fallback guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Implement `/ui/logs` service; add pagination, severity filters, and export; surface failure banner with support contact when API down.                                                                                                                              |
| **Settings & Fleet** – `/settings`, `/fleet`, `/fleet/1`, `/fleet/layout` all return 404 with same generic error copy (screenshots in `screenshots/settings.png`, `.../fleet-*.png`; logs in respective JSON files).                                                     | Configuration, fleet state, and layout editing are unavailable; generic messaging omits which feature is impacted and next steps.                                                                                                                           | Restore routes or feature-flag nav; provide context-specific messaging (e.g., "Fleet layout service disabled in prod") and link to documentation/support.                                                                                                           |
