# UI/UX Phase C Audit — 2025-09-25

## Summary
- Stabilised the operator-facing logs view with the new API contract, level filtering, correlation search, and deterministic mock streaming behaviour.
- Clarified camera module messaging by surfacing the MediaMTX integration gap and wiring the UI through `/ui/camera/*` proxies with enriched mock data.
- Rebuilt the fleet overview and device detail flows to consume the proxy APIs, expose realistic device metadata, and replace speculative quick actions with guarded copy.

## Fixes shipped
- `/logs` now uses `logs-operations` helpers for JSON + SSE, filters by severity, and allows correlation ID search; mocks emit deterministic events for UX tests.
- `/camera` consumes summary/events/preview proxies, renders a meaningful placeholder reason (`MediaMTX not integrated`), and lists registered cameras with status badges.
- `/fleet` renders SSR-fetched device cards; `/fleet/[id]` derives device context from `fetchState` + audio snapshots and shows recent log excerpts for the device.
- Settings page styles remain scoped to the route to avoid shell leakage while keeping mocked fields aligned with future backend contract.

## Mocked interactions
- Settings form persists only in-memory until backend endpoints exist (restart banner retained).
- Camera preview streams stay mocked; MediaMTX wiring is pending backend integration.
- Device-level actions (restart/resync) remain non-interactive placeholders until job queue APIs land.

## Blocked by backend
- Persisting API bearer/proxy timeout/debug logging toggles from `/settings` awaits configuration endpoints.
- Live camera preview and event ingestion depend on MediaMTX + camera-control deployment.
- Device quick actions rely on worker queue/command APIs to avoid false affordances.

## Test coverage
- `apps/ui/tests/ux/logs.spec.ts` — validates level filtering, correlation search, and stream pause/resume.
- `apps/ui/tests/ux/camera.spec.ts` — asserts camera placeholder reason renders for offline preview.
- `apps/ui/tests/ux/fleet-detail.spec.ts` — exercises navigation from `/fleet` to `/fleet/[id]` and verifies status/log excerpts.

## Remaining UX gaps
- Health route (`/health`) still surfaces a placeholder; awaiting API wiring before replacing audit warning.
- No toast feedback for log stream connectivity—consider subtle banner when SSE disconnects in live mode.
- Fleet overview currently lists audio agents only; extend to video/zigbee/camera once `/fleet/state` aggregates additional modules.
