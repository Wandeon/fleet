# Phase C UX Audit â€“ 2025-09-25

## What shipped
- **Logs console** now streams real data with per-source filtering, severity controls, download options, and in-app exports wired through the new `logs-operations` layer. Mock data models reflect realistic sources, severities, and contexts.
- **Camera workflows** expose multi-device previews, event acknowledgement, clip navigation, and stream refresh backed by the camera operations shim. Device switching updates preview, clips, and events through the helper API so operators see actionable state.
- **Settings** page now reads from the shared settings state, supports token rotation, proxy updates, pairing management, and operator invitations/removals. The UI reflects pending restarts and pairing queues.
- **Fleet overview & device detail** provide real-time module summaries, filtering, and richly instrumented device pages with metrics, alerts, logs, connection info, and action execution pipelines.
- **Playwright UX tests** cover logs filtering/export, camera job flows, and fleet device actions. Capture suite refreshed to reflect redesigned pages.
- **UX capture artefacts** stored at `/opt/fleet/ux-audit/20250925T060143/` for regression reviews.

## Still mocked / future work
- Camera clip generation and stream URLs remain mock-backed until `/camera/events/:id/clip` is available.
- Device action execution falls back to mocks for unsupported API endpoints; emitted TODO logs highlight gaps.
- Operator invitation and removal calls rely on mock updates when backend endpoints are absent; once provisioned, switch over to REST handlers.
- Pairing discovery is simulated via mock cadence; integrate with Zigbee coordinator events when connectors mature.

## Blockers
- Missing backend endpoints for `/camera/overview`, `/settings/*`, and `/fleet/devices/:id/actions/:actionId` prevent live operation; tracked in backend backlog issue #1763.
- Streaming logs rely on SSE `/logs/stream` endpoint; ensure deployment config keeps proxy heartbeat open to avoid involuntary disconnects.
- Operator invitation workflow needs email delivery integration (SES/Twilio SendGrid) before enabling in production.

## Follow-up recommendations
1. Wire backend endpoints listed above to transition off mocks; prioritize camera clip service and fleet actions for operator parity.
2. Extend pairing UI with QR code rendering for `method === 'qr'` once tokens are issued by hardware service.
3. Add device-level health analytics (sparkline charts) by expanding metric shape to include time-series data.
4. Capture regression screenshots for all high-value workflows and store under `/opt/fleet/ux-audit/` during CI for ongoing baselines.
