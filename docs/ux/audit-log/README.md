# UX Playwright Audit Log

This directory stores a chronological archive of automated UX audits, screenshots, and gap reports generated by Playwright. Each entry is tagged with the calendar date of the run and the Git commit SHA that introduced the evidence so that design and operations teams can trace changes over time.

## Adding new evidence

1. Create a new folder inside `docs/ux/audit-log/` using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-sha>-HHMMSS`.
2. Copy the Playwright output (`*.md`, `*.log`, JSON traces, and screenshots) into the new folder.
3. Update the table above with the date, commit SHA, folder link, and a short summary of the run.

This structure creates a living timeline that designers and operators can reference when auditing UX changes or planning follow-up work.
