# Snapcast Synchronized Audio - Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Partial Implementation - VPS Ready, Pi Devices Pending

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### VPS Infrastructure

1. **Snapcast Server Added** (`infra/vps/compose.fleet.yml`)
   - Service definition complete
   - Volumes configured (snapcast-data, liquidsoap-fifo)
   - Ports exposed (1704, 1705)
   - Healthcheck configured

2. **Snapcast Configuration** (`infra/vps/config/snapcast.json`)
   - Buffer: 1000ms (optimal for sync)
   - Sample format: 48kHz, 16-bit stereo
   - HTTP/TCP ports configured
   - Logging configured

3. **Liquidsoap Dual Output** (`infra/vps/liquidsoap/playlist.liq`)
   - Icecast output preserved (web/monitoring)
   - Snapcast FIFO output added (synchronized playback)
   - Both outputs run in parallel

4. **Liquidsoap Docker Config** (`infra/vps/compose.liquidsoap.yml`)
   - FIFO volume mounted
   - External volume reference added

### Pi Device Role Files Created

1. **Liquidsoap Fallback Script** (`roles/audio-player/docker/app/fallback.liq`)
   - Local file playback with looping
   - Volume control via interactive vars
   - Telnet control on localhost:1235
   - Normalization and gating

2. **Snapcast-Aware Control API** (`roles/audio-player/docker/app/control_snapcast.py`)
   - Complete implementation with Snapcast integration
   - Mode switching logic (Snapcast ‚Üî Fallback)
   - Connection monitoring thread
   - Docker container management
   - New metrics: `snapcast_connected`, `audio_buffer_seconds`
   - Volume starts at 0% for safe testing

## ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for Deployment

### VPS Components - READY

All VPS changes are complete and ready to deploy:
- Snapcast server container configured
- Updated Liquidsoap with dual output (Icecast + Snapcast FIFO)
- Shared FIFO volume configured

**Deployment command:**
```bash
cd /home/admin/fleet/infra/vps

# Create the FIFO volume first
docker volume create vps_liquidsoap-fifo

# Restart Liquidsoap with FIFO mount
docker compose -f compose.liquidsoap.yml down
docker compose -f compose.liquidsoap.yml up -d

# Start Snapcast server
docker compose -f compose.fleet.yml up -d snapcast-server

# Verify
docker logs snapcast-server --tail 50
docker logs liquidsoap --tail 50 | grep -i snapcast
```

### Pi Device Role - COMPLETE

All Pi device files are now complete and ready for deployment:

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `40-app.yml` with snapcast-client, audio-fallback, and updated audio-control services
- ‚úÖ `control_snapcast.py` with Snapcast integration, mode switching, and failover logic
- ‚úÖ `fallback.liq` Liquidsoap script for local fallback playback
- ‚úÖ `.env.snapcast.example` template with deployment instructions
- ‚úÖ Volume set to 0.0 by default for safe testing

**Environment configuration:**
- Device-specific `.env` file needs to be created from `.env.snapcast.example`
- Must set: DEVICE_ID, SNAPCAST_SERVER (VPS Tailscale IP)
- Default AUDIO_VOLUME=0.0 is already configured for safe testing

### Fleet API - COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-upload fallback functionality in `apps/api/src/services/audio.ts`
- ‚úÖ Checks if device has fallback file
- ‚úÖ Uploads `/srv/Audio/fallback.mp3` from VPS if missing
- ‚úÖ Integrated into `playDeviceSource()` - runs on first playback

### UI Updates - COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Sync mode indicators in `apps/ui/src/lib/modules/AudioModule.svelte`
- ‚úÖ Shows "üéµ Synchronized" when syncGroup is present
- ‚úÖ Shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback" when playing without syncGroup
- ‚úÖ Visual styling with green badges for sync, yellow for fallback

## üéØ Recommended Approach: Staged Implementation

### Stage 1: VPS Only (Safe, Non-Breaking)

**What:** Deploy Snapcast server on VPS, verify it works independently

**Actions:**
1. Deploy VPS changes (Snapcast + updated Liquidsoap)
2. Verify Snapcast server running and listening
3. Verify Liquidsoap writing to FIFO
4. Verify Icecast still working (backward compat)

**Risk:** None - Pi devices continue using Icecast

**Timeline:** 30 minutes

### Stage 2: Create Default Fallback File

**What:** Create `/srv/Audio/fallback.mp3` for auto-sync

**Actions:**
1. Choose/create appropriate fallback audio
2. Place in `/srv/Audio/fallback.mp3`
3. Verify file accessible from fleet-api container

**Risk:** None - just preparation

**Timeline:** 15 minutes

### Stage 3: Update Fleet API (Auto-Upload)

**What:** Add auto-upload fallback logic to API

**Actions:**
1. Update `apps/api/src/services/audio.ts` with autoUploadFallback()
2. Integrate into playDeviceSource()
3. Build and deploy API
4. Test fallback upload manually

**Risk:** Low - only adds feature, doesn't change existing behavior

**Timeline:** 1 hour

### Stage 4: Convert One Pi Device (pi-audio-01)

**What:** Full Snapcast implementation on single device

**Actions:**
1. Create complete updated 40-app.yml for Snapcast
2. Update device configuration
3. Deploy to pi-audio-01 only
4. Test extensively with volume at 0%
5. Monitor for 24 hours

**Risk:** Medium - affects one device, can rollback

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours + 24h monitoring

### Stage 5: Convert Second Pi Device (pi-audio-02)

**What:** Roll out to remaining device

**Actions:**
1. Apply same configuration to pi-audio-02
2. Deploy
3. Test sync between devices
4. Verify both show as synchronized

**Risk:** Low - proven on first device

**Timeline:** 1 hour

### Stage 6: UI Updates for Monitoring

**What:** Enhance UI to show sync status

**Actions:**
1. Update AudioModule to show mode (Snapcast/Fallback)
2. Add sync indicators
3. Show buffer status
4. Display connection health

**Risk:** None - UI only

**Timeline:** 2 hours

## ‚úÖ All Implementation Complete

All code components are now complete and ready for deployment. No technical blockers remain.

---

## üí° Deployment Recommendation

All implementation is complete. Recommended deployment approach:

### Staged Deployment (Recommended)

**Stage 1: VPS Only (5 minutes, no risk)**
1. Deploy Snapcast server and updated Liquidsoap on VPS
2. Verify both services running
3. Pi devices continue using existing system - no impact

**Stage 2: Create Fallback File (10 minutes)**
1. Find/create appropriate ambient audio for `/srv/Audio/fallback.mp3`
2. Should be 5-10MB, calm background music
3. Place on VPS for auto-sync to devices

**Stage 3: Deploy to pi-audio-01 (30 minutes testing)**
1. Get VPS Tailscale IP: `tailscale status` on VPS
2. Create `.env` from `.env.snapcast.example` with:
   - `DEVICE_ID=pi-audio-01`
   - `SNAPCAST_SERVER=<VPS_TAILSCALE_IP>`
   - `AUDIO_VOLUME=0.0` (already default)
3. Trigger role-agent deployment
4. Test with volume at 0% - verify mode switching
5. Monitor for 1-2 hours

**Stage 4: Deploy to pi-audio-02 (15 minutes)**
1. Repeat Stage 3 with `DEVICE_ID=pi-audio-02`
2. Test synchronization between both devices
3. Verify no audible drift or echo

**Stage 5: Build and Deploy UI (10 minutes)**
1. Build UI with new sync indicators
2. Deploy to VPS
3. Verify sync status visible at app.headspamartina.hr

### Quick Deployment (Higher Risk)

Deploy everything simultaneously. Only recommended if you have easy physical access to devices for debugging.

---

## üìä What User Can See Now

Currently, the UI at app.headspamartina.hr shows:
- Audio devices with standard FFmpeg-based playback
- No sync indication (because sync doesn't exist yet)
- Current playback mode (stream/stop)
- Volume controls

After full implementation, UI will show:
- Playback mode: "Synchronized" (Snapcast) or "Fallback" (local)
- Connection status: Connected/Disconnected to server
- Buffer depth: ~1.0s (normal) or 0s (disconnected)
- Sync status between devices
- Last mode switch timestamp
- Visual indicators for fallback mode

---

**All implementation is complete!** Ready for deployment when you are.
