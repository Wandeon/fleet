=== CURRENT CI STATE ANALYSIS ===
Date: Thu Sep 26 11:32:20 CEST 2025

## Critical Findings

**Main Branch Status**: 100% CI failure rate
**Last Successful Run**: None found in recent history
**Primary Failure Mode**: "workflow file issue" suggesting configuration problems

## Recent CI Run Analysis

**Latest Main CI Run**: 18033606018 (12 minutes ago)

- Status: FAILED
- Error: "This run likely failed because of a workflow file issue"
- Branch: main (commit 477ca1b)
- Affected: PR #86 merge (D3b: Zigbee rules & settings)

**Failure Pattern**:

- All workflows failing: ci.yml, contract-ci.yml, acceptance.yml, deploy-vps.yml
- Consistent "workflow file issue" suggests YAML syntax or configuration error

## Root Cause Hypothesis

**Primary Issue**: PR #85 (OpenAPI cleanup) + PR #86 (D3b) interaction created type mismatches
**Evidence**:

- client.ts has reverted to old broken type exports (CameraEventDetection, ApiAccessSettings, etc.)
- AudioService API signatures reverted to old style with options parameter
- VideoState vs VideoOverview type mismatch remains

## Jobs Failing

Based on workflow failure pattern:

1. **lint** - Likely failing on type errors
2. **typecheck** - Definitely failing on missing type exports
3. **build** - Cannot proceed due to type errors
4. **test** - Cannot run due to build failure
5. **contract** - May be passing (Node 20 fix intact)

## Immediate Action Required

**Step 1 Priority**: Fix OpenAPI client/UI type mismatches
**Approach**: Forward-fix (not revert) to preserve D3b changes
**Target**: Surgical edits to restore type compatibility
