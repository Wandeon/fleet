# Device Detail Page Testing Report

**Test Date:** October 3, 2025
**Environment:** Production (https://app.headspamartina.hr)
**Test Type:** Black-box UI Testing
**Tester:** Automated Playwright Test Suite

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING: Device Detail Pages Are Not Functional**

The device detail page feature (`/fleet/[id]`) is **not implemented** in the production API, resulting in 404 errors for all device detail pages. While the frontend UI code exists and is properly structured, the backend API endpoint `/fleet/devices/:id` does not exist.

### Test Results
- **Devices Identified:** 4 (2 audio, 1 video, 1 camera)
- **Devices Tested:** 2 (1 audio, 1 video)
- **Pages Loading Successfully:** 0
- **Buttons Tested:** 0
- **Status:** BLOCKED - API Not Implemented

---

## Devices Discovered

From the fleet overview page, the following devices were identified:

| Device Name | Device ID | Type | Location | Status |
|-------------|-----------|------|----------|--------|
| Audio Pi 01 | pi-audio-01 | audio | Living Room | online |
| Audio Pi 02 | pi-audio-02 | audio | Kitchen | online |
| HDMI Pi 01 | pi-video-01 | video | TV Wall | online |
| Camera Pi 01 | pi-camera-01 | camera | Front Entrance | online |

## Test Execution

### Test Methodology
1. Navigated to `/fleet` page to discover devices
2. Extracted device IDs by clicking device cards and monitoring navigation
3. Attempted to load device detail pages at `/fleet/{device-id}`
4. Analyzed page response and identified interactive elements

### Audio Device Test: pi-audio-01
- **URL Attempted:** `https://app.headspamartina.hr/fleet/pi-audio-01`
- **Result:** ❌ **FAILED**
- **Error:** "Something went wrong - We couldn't load the requested page"
- **Root Cause:** API endpoint `/fleet/devices/pi-audio-01` returns 404
- **Evidence:** Screenshot saved to `screenshots/audio-pi-audio-01.png`

### Video Device Test: pi-video-01
- **URL Attempted:** `https://app.headspamartina.hr/fleet/pi-video-01`
- **Result:** ❌ **FAILED**
- **Error:** "Something went wrong - We couldn't load the requested page"
- **Root Cause:** API endpoint `/fleet/devices/pi-video-01` returns 404
- **Evidence:** Screenshot saved to `screenshots/video-pi-video-01.png`

## Technical Analysis

### Frontend Implementation ✅
The frontend UI is properly implemented:
- **Route:** `/apps/ui/src/routes/fleet/[id]/+page.svelte`
- **Load Function:** `/apps/ui/src/routes/fleet/[id]/+page.ts`
- **API Client:** `/apps/ui/src/lib/api/fleet-operations.ts`

The page is designed to display:
- Device summary (ID, location, groups, IP, version)
- Live metrics and telemetry
- Active alerts
- Recent logs
- **Quick Actions** (control buttons)
- Connection status

### Backend Implementation ❌
The backend API is **missing the device detail endpoint**:
- **File:** `/apps/api/src/routes/fleet.ts`
- **Existing Endpoints:**
  - `GET /fleet/layout` ✅
  - `GET /fleet/overview` ✅
  - `GET /fleet/state` ✅
  - `GET /fleet/devices/:id` ❌ **MISSING**
  - `POST /fleet/devices/:id/actions/:actionId` ❌ **MISSING**

### Expected API Contract
Based on the frontend code, the missing endpoint should:
```typescript
GET /fleet/devices/:id
Response: FleetDeviceDetail {
  summary: { id, name, role, module, status, location, groups, lastSeen, ipAddress, version }
  metrics: FleetDeviceMetric[]
  alerts: Alert[]
  logs: LogEntry[]
  actions: FleetDeviceAction[]  // Quick Actions
  connections: Connection[]
}
```

---

## Quick Actions Expected (Not Testable)

Based on the frontend implementation, the device detail page should display "Quick Actions" buttons in the "Actions" card. These would be dynamically loaded from the API response's `actions` array.

### Expected Action Types
- **Maintenance actions:** Secondary button styling
- **Control actions:** Ghost button styling
- Each action should:
  - POST to `/fleet/devices/:id/actions/:actionId`
  - Show loading state ("Running…")
  - Refresh device state on completion
  - Display errors if action fails

### Could Not Test
❌ Cannot enumerate specific actions without API access
❌ Cannot test button click handlers
❌ Cannot verify network requests
❌ Cannot validate state updates

---

## Tabs and Panels Analysis

The device detail page does not use traditional tabs. Instead, it uses a **card-based layout** with the following sections:

1. **Summary Card** - Device identification and metadata
2. **Metrics Card** - Live telemetry data
3. **Alerts Card** - Outstanding issues
4. **Recent Logs Card** - Latest activity with link to logs console
5. **Actions Card** - Quick Actions control buttons ⚠️
6. **Connections Card** - Downstream dependencies

### Interactive Elements Expected
- **Refresh button** (header) - Reloads device data
- **Action buttons** (Actions card) - Execute device operations
- **Logs console link** - Navigates to `/logs?source={deviceId}`
- **Fleet breadcrumb** - Navigates back to `/fleet`

## Artifacts Collected

### Screenshots
- ✅ `screenshots/01-fleet-page.png` - Fleet overview showing all devices
- ✅ `screenshots/audio-pi-audio-01.png` - Audio device error page
- ✅ `screenshots/video-pi-video-01.png` - Video device error page

### Test Data
- ✅ `results.json` - Structured test results (0 buttons tested)
- ✅ `buttons.csv` - CSV export (empty due to API issue)
- ✅ `error.log` - Error details from test execution
- ✅ `console.log` - Browser console output showing 404 errors

### Network Logs
Console shows:
```
[error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## Recommendations

### Critical Priority
1. **Implement Backend API Endpoint**
   - Add `GET /fleet/devices/:id` to return FleetDeviceDetail
   - Add `POST /fleet/devices/:id/actions/:actionId` for action execution
   - Reference: `/apps/ui/src/lib/api/fleet-operations.ts` for expected contract

### Testing Priority
2. **Re-run Device Detail Tests** once API is implemented
   - Test all Quick Actions on audio devices
   - Test all Quick Actions on video devices (TV power, input, volume, mute)
   - Verify probe stream functionality
   - Test logs pane refresh
   - Validate config toggles if present

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify device navigation from fleet page works
   - Test breadcrumb navigation back to fleet
   - Verify logs console link navigation
   - Test error handling for offline devices

## Exit Summary

**Device Detail Testing: BLOCKED**

**Findings:**
- ✅ 4 devices identified successfully (2 audio, 1 video, 1 camera)
- ✅ Device navigation working (fleet cards clickable)
- ❌ 0 device detail pages loading (404 errors)
- ❌ 0 Quick Actions testable (API not implemented)
- ❌ Backend API endpoint `/fleet/devices/:id` missing

**Notable Issues:**
1. **BLOCKER:** Device detail API endpoint not implemented in production
2. Frontend code is complete and ready, but cannot function without backend
3. All device detail pages return "Something went wrong" error
4. Quick Actions, metrics, alerts, and logs cannot be tested until API is available

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement missing backend API endpoints
2. Deploy to production
3. Re-run this test suite to verify all Quick Actions and UI controls

**Test Status:** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE - API NOT IMPLEMENTED**
