# CI Pipeline Sanity Check

This file verifies that the CI pipeline is functioning correctly after the stabilization fixes.

## Purpose

This sanity PR demonstrates:
- ✅ CI workflows execute without failures
- ✅ All stabilization fixes are working correctly
- ✅ Pipeline is ready for production deployments

## Test Details

**Branch**: `sanity/verify-ci-stability`
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Changes**: Minimal documentation addition to trigger CI

## Expected Outcome

All CI checks should pass, demonstrating that:
1. Smoke verification completes without timeout
2. Contract validation works correctly
3. TypeScript compilation succeeds
4. All module smoke tests pass
5. OpenAPI drift detection functions properly
6. Release readiness assessment completes

## Stabilization Summary

The following systematic fixes have been applied to ensure reliable CI:

- **OpenAPI validation**: swagger-cli integration
- **Port drift detection**: Fixed false positives
- **Smoke verification**: Centralized mock harness with timeout protection
- **ESLint configuration**: Test file exclusion patterns
- **Release readiness**: Graceful permission error handling
- **Workflow permissions**: Proper GitHub Actions integration
